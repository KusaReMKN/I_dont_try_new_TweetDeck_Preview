# I don't try the new TweetDeck Preview

😢 **The legacy TweetDeck has gone and this extension is now useless!**

This is a Chrome/Firefox extension that hides the 'Try the new TweetDeck
Preview' banner that appears on legacy TweetDeck.

## Installation

You can install this extension for Firefox via addons.mozilla.org:
